Systems Programming CS214 with Professor Menendez

To test the correctness of the program, we created a bash script that ran
multiple test cases.

Each test case involved an input file, a lineWidth, and a hand made output file
that the bash script would test against using dif. For many test cases, we used
the same input file and only changed the lineWidth. This ensured that the
program works on small lineWidths such as 1 or 5 and larger lineWidths like 20,
30, 40, etc.

Since dif checks the bytes of the file, we were able to ensure that the wrapping
algorithm did not add any unnecessary whitespace and that the algorithm worked
according to specifications.

The bash script also ran valgrind on each test case and reported back any memory
leaks and other program problems. All problems were fixed until no valgrind
errors were reported.
